//! Test-only fixtures. Carries enough state to populate every bundle
//! in this crate from a `(Pool, UserAccounts)` pair, so integration
//! tests can build instructions in one `Bundle::from(...)` call.
//!
//! Lives in the program crate (rather than in each test's `common/`
//! module) because the per-ix bundle structs (`SwapBundle`,
//! `AddLiquidityBundle`, ...) live here, and `#[derive(BundleFrom)]`
//! needs the source-fixture types to be visible from the same crate
//! the bundle is declared in. Layering aside, that has a side benefit:
//! downstream programs that CPI into this AMM get the test fixtures
//! for free.
//!
//! Gated on `not(target_os = "solana")` + `not(target_os = "solana")`
//! so nothing here escapes into the on-chain BPF binary.
