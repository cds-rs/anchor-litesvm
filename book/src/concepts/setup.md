# Setup

Setup has two jobs: get the program(s) onto the SVM, then populate the
World's cast and event registry so the rest of the test can talk about actors
and events instead of raw accounts and log bytes.

## Deploying

`AnchorLiteSVM::build_with_program` deploys a single program and returns a
ready `AnchorContext`:

```rust
let mut ctx =
    AnchorLiteSVM::build_with_program(vault::ID, "vault", &common::fixture_bytes("vault"));
```

`program_bytes` is a compiled `.so`'s contents, typically a committed fixture
loaded with `include_bytes!("../fixtures/vault.so")`. The `"vault"` name is
registered as an alias for `vault::ID`, so a failing transaction's tree names
the program `vault` instead of its raw pubkey.

When a program CPIs into another one your test must also deploy (the stake
example calls into `mpl-core`), use `build_with_programs` instead, which takes
a list and aliases each entry the same way:

```rust
let mut ctx = AnchorLiteSVM::build_with_programs(&[
    (STAKING_ID, "staking", &common::fixture_bytes("staking")),
    (MPL_CORE_ID, "mpl_core", &common::fixture_bytes("mpl_core")),
]);
```

The first program passed becomes the context's primary `program_id`.

## Casting the scenario

With the context built, cast the actors and accounts the scenario needs. The
vault chapter's full setup:

```rust
fn boot() -> anchor_litesvm::AnchorContext {
    let mut ctx =
        AnchorLiteSVM::build_with_program(vault::ID, "vault", &common::fixture_bytes("vault"));
    // Decode `Deposited` badges from the committed IDL.
    ctx.register_events_from_idl(include_str!("../idls/vault.json"));
    ctx
}
```

```rust
let mut ctx = boot();
let alice = ctx.cast_actor("Alice");
```

`cast_actor(name)` casts a funded, aliased signer, as covered in
[Aliases & Actors](aliases.md). Two more cast methods round out the
vocabulary for token scenarios (used throughout the escrow example):

- `cast_mint(name, &authority, decimals)` casts a token mint under
  `authority`, aliased `name`.
- `fund_ata(&owner, &mint, &authority, amount)` creates `owner`'s associated
  token account for `mint`, mints `amount` into it from `authority`, and
  aliases the ATA `"<owner>/<mint>"`.

`register_events_from_idl(idl_json)` reads an Anchor IDL (embedded with
`include_str!` so it travels with the test binary) and registers a decoder
for every event it declares. From then on, any `emit!`ed event in the
program's logs decodes into a typed value (`result.parse_event::<T>()`) and
renders as a `🔔` badge in the printed tree, covered next in
[Structured Logs](structured-logs.md). For a program with no IDL (the stake
example's hand-built `.so`), `register_program_errors` is the error-side
equivalent: it names custom error codes directly instead of reading them out
of an IDL.
