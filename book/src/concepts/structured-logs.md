# Structured Logs

Every `send_ok` / `send_err` / `send_err_named` call returns a
`TransactionResult`. Its `tree_string()` method renders the run's raw logs
as a CPI tree: one line per invoke frame, decoded events as badges, a failing
leaf named instead of a bare error code, and a legend mapping every alias
back to its address. This is the anatomy the rest of the book's captures are
made of; this chapter walks it line by line against the vault deposit
capture, then the negative-path capture for the failure-specific parts.

## Anatomy of a passing run

```text
{{#include ../captured/vault_deposit.txt}}
```

- `── vault::Deposit ──` is the title bar: the top frame's program (alias
  `vault`) and, when the logs name it, the instruction (`Deposit`).
- `Transaction  signers=[Alice]` lists the transaction's required-signature
  keys, alias-resolved. One line, regardless of how many frames follow.
- `└── vault::Deposit [1] ✓ 6874cu  signer=Alice` is the top-level frame:
  `[1]` is the invoke depth, `✓` the outcome, `6874cu` the compute units
  *this frame* consumed, and `signer=Alice` names who signed for it (only
  top-level frames carry a signer annotation).
- `├── System [2] ✓ (no cu)` is a nested CPI one level deeper (`[2]`): the
  lamport transfer `deposit` makes into the vault PDA via `system_program`.
  `(no cu)` appears when the runtime's logs don't report a per-frame figure
  for that invocation.
- `└── 🔔 Deposited { user: Alice, amount: 1000000000, vault_balance:
  1000000000 }` is a decoded event badge, a leaf sibling of the CPI frames
  inside the frame that emitted it. `register_events_from_idl` (see
  [Setup](setup.md)) is what makes this renderable at all; without a
  registered decoder for `Deposited`, the raw base64 payload would print
  instead. `user` reads `Alice` because the decoder resolves pubkey fields
  through the same alias table as everything else.
- The footer reports total compute units and the fee charged, then
  `Legend (2):` lists the two non-default aliases this run actually
  touched, `Alice` and `vault`, next to their real addresses. See
  [Aliases & Actors](aliases.md) for why `System` doesn't appear here too.

`├──`/`└──` connectors and indentation track invoke depth and whether a frame
is the last child at its level, standard tree-drawing rules; a frame with
siblings after it gets `├──`, the last gets `└──`.

## Anatomy of a failing run

The `✗` mark and a leaf under the failing frame name the failure directly:

```text
{{#include ../captured/vault_wrong_state.txt}}
```

`└── vault::Deposit [1] ✗ 5225cu  signer=Alice` then `└── Error:
ConstraintSeeds` names the constraint that rejected the swapped account,
resolved from the `Error Code: ConstraintSeeds. Error Number: 2006.` line
Anchor itself logs (an `AnchorError`). The `Error:
InstructionError(0, Custom(2006))` line beneath the tree is the raw
`TransactionError` the runtime returned; it's always there on failure, the
named leaf above it is what makes the tree readable without decoding the
custom code by hand.

Not every failure comes from an Anchor-logged error: a program built without
an IDL has no `Error Code:` log line to read, so its custom codes need a
name registered by hand with `register_program_errors` (`FreezePeriodNotElapsed`
in the [Stake](../examples/stake.md) chapter). The failure leaf resolves in
this order: the `AnchorError` log line, then the registered error-name table,
then the raw error as a last resort. Escrow's and Vault's failure leaves
(`ConstraintSeeds`, `ConstraintTokenOwner`, `EscrowExpired`, ...) all come
from Anchor's own logs; see the [Vault](../examples/vault.md) and
[Escrow](../examples/escrow.md) chapters for those captures.

## Sending: `send_ok` / `send_err` / `send_err_named`

The three context-level senders share a signature and differ only in what
they assert:

- `ctx.send_ok(ix, &[&signer])` asserts the transaction succeeds.
- `ctx.send_err(ix, &[&signer])` asserts it fails, any error.
- `ctx.send_err_named(ix, &[&signer], "ConstraintSeeds")` asserts it fails
  *and* that the failure resolves to (or its logs contain) the given name.

All three return the `TransactionResult` whose `tree_string()` is what's
captured above. The fluent `ctx.tx(&[&signer]).build(bundle, args)` chain
terminates in the same three verbs (`.send_ok()`, `.send_err()`,
`.send_err_named("Name")`).

## Printing vs. capturing

`result.print_logs()` prints the tree to stdout and returns `self`, so it
chains at the end of a call (`ctx.send_ok(ix, signers).print_logs();`).
`result.tree_string()` returns the same content as a `String` instead of
printing it; every `{{#include}}` block in this book is a `tree_string()`
capture, verbatim, checked against a committed fixture so it can't drift from
what the code actually renders.
